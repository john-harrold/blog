description: Welcome to the `nlmixr2` blog. This is intended to be a place in which the development team can write about various aspects of the project when they get the occasional bit of bandwidth (which will probably not be all that often, given that we're all unpaid volunteers with day jobs, but hey, we'll do our best).
