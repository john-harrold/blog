  abstract = {In pharmacometrics, we try to understand how the dose of a drug and measurable attributes of patients influence their drug concentration-time profiles, and to relate drug concentration-time profiles and patient attributes to the time profile of drug effects. Using this information, we can use tools like "nlmixr" to try to identify the right dose for the right patient. Our discipline is a fusion of pharmacol-ogy, physiology, and quantitative sciences, such as statistics. Statistical methods commonly practiced in the analysis of clinical studies often utilize linear mixed models to investigate trial outcomes. The characterization of longitudinal concentration and drug effect in pharmacometrics extends this statistical paradigm to include nonlinear models, which are often based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These ODEs are required to describe complex systems affecting concentrations and effects of drugs that often cannot be described by simple linear models. Nonlinear models can be fitted using the statistical language R 1 with its included "nlme" package. The nlme package allows the expression of nonlinear functions in R and fitting these models in a nonlinear mixed effect (NLME) modeling statistical framework. Only nonlinear equations with closed-form solutions can be used, however, and if more than one dose is administered to a patient, these equations quickly become extremely complex. The nlmixr package 2 extends nlme by providing the ability to add flexible individual-based dosing regimens, and to describe the models using both ODEs and solved systems when these are available. The nlmixr package has made these ODEs easy to express by using Leibniz notation (see below). To run the model, one specifies the ODE/solved system and provides initial estimates for the model as described in the nlmixr tuto-rial. 2 The model then can be solved using the nlme algorithm, or, more optimally, using more advanced algorithms that have been shown to provide more accurate parameter estimates like first-order conditional estimation with interaction (FOCEI) 3 and stochastic approximation expectation maximization (SAEM). 3 Statisticians who are familiar with nlme and are becoming familiar with population pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PDs) may thus find it relatively straightforward to transition from nlme to more robust methodologies and more complex models and data structures. An example of nlmixr applied to a simple PK system serves to illustrate the uncomplicated syntax and how a transition to more complex and robust NLME methodologies might be accomplished without leaving the familiar R environment. Theophylline is used to inhibit phosphodiesterase and is used as treatment in many respiratory diseases. The analysis of the theophylline dataset of Dr. Upton 4 is one of the most common introductory applications of NLME modeling, and is a common introductory dataset for learning nlme (it is included in the base R distribution as the Theoph and reformatted and supplied in nlmixr as theo_sd and extrapolated to multiple doses with theo_ md). If a single dose is given at time zero, the equations can be expressed as the closed-form solution to a one-compartment oral absorption system, and analyzed using nlme. In the syntax of nlmixr, fitting of the theophylline PK can be specified as: This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited and is not used for commercial purposes.},

  abstract = {The free and open-source package nlmixr implements pharmacometric nonlinear mixed effects model parameter estimation in R. It provides a uniform language to define pharmacometric models using ordinary differential equations. Performances of the stochastic approximation expectation-maximization (SAEM) and first order-conditional estimation with interaction (FOCEI) algorithms in nlmixr were compared with those found in the industry standards, Monolix and NONMEM, using the following two scenarios: a simple model fit to 500 sparsely sampled data sets and a range of more complex compartmental models with linear and nonlinear clearance fit to data sets with rich sampling. Estimation results obtained from nlmixr for FOCEI and SAEM matched the corresponding output from NONMEM/FOCEI and Monolix/SAEM closely both in terms of parameter estimates and associated standard errors. These results indicate that nlmixr may provide a viable alternative to existing tools for pharmacometric parameter estimation.},

abstract = {mrgsolve is an open-source R package available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network. It combines R and C++ coding for simulation from hierarchical, ordinary differential equation–based models. Its efficient simulation engine and integration into a parallelizable, R-based workflow makes mrgsolve a convenient tool both for simple and complex models and thus is ideal for physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) and quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model. This tutorial will first introduce the basics of the mrgsolve simulation workflow, including model specification, the introduction of interventions (dosing events) into the simulation, and simulated results postprocessing. An applied simulation example is then presented using a PBPK model for voriconazole, including a model validation step against adult and pediatric data sets. A final simulation example is then presented using a previously published QSP model for mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in colorectal cancer, illustrating population simulation of different combination therapies.},

@article{Hasegawa2018,
abstract = {Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic systems are often expressed with nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While there are numerous methods to solve such ODEs these methods generally rely on time-stepping solutions (e.g. Runge–Kutta) which need to be matched to the characteristics of the problem at hand. The primary aim of this study was to explore the performance of an inductive approximation which iteratively converts nonlinear ODEs to linear time-varying systems which can then be solved algebraically or numerically. The inductive approximation is applied to three examples, a simple nonlinear pharmacokinetic model with Michaelis–Menten elimination (E1), an integrated glucose–insulin model and an HIV viral load model with recursive feedback systems (E2 and E3, respectively). The secondary aim of this study was to explore the potential advantages of analytically solving linearized ODEs with two examples, again E3 with stiff differential equations and a turnover model of luteinizing hormone with a surge function (E4). The inductive linearization coupled with a matrix exponential solution provided accurate predictions for all examples with comparable solution time to the matched time-stepping solutions for nonlinear ODEs. The time-stepping solutions however did not perform well for E4, particularly when the surge was approximated by a square wave. In circumstances when either a linear ODE is particularly desirable or the uncertainty in matching the integrator to the ODE system is of potential risk, then the inductive approximation method coupled with an analytical integration method would be an appropriate alternative.},

abstract = {Rapid and accurate solutions for nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that arise in the pharmaceutical sciences are desirable. This is particularly important in the area of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamics modelling and design. We describe an iterative linearization to generate inductive approximations which converge to the solution. These approximations allow quick and accurate evaluations of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic PKPD models. The inductive approximations are applied to a simple nonlinear pharmacokinetic (PK) model, ie a model that is nonlinear when expressed as an ordinary differential equation, and show the utility of the method. Because the approximations depend continuously on the parameters and time, the inductive method is particularly suitable for parameter estimation and optimal design approaches.},
